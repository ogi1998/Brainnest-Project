  <h2>Don't Feed the Monkey Mind</h2>
  <a href="./books.html">Go Back</a>
  <p>This is one of the very first self-help books I read. It is a psychology book and it is about how our brain react in certain situations.</p>
  <p>Those situations can be procrastinating, being lazy, anxiety and why do we do those things.</p>
  <p>It really helped me understand some important things and they helped me a lot.</p>
