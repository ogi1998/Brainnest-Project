  <h2>Cracking the Coding Interview</h2>
  <a href="./books.html">Go Back</a>
  <p>This book is quite different, compared to previous ones.</p>
  <p>It is more of a technical book, explaining how the process of technical interview works in big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft...</p>
  <p>It also goes through examples of coding questions and how to behave in an interview.</p>
  <p>I recently started reading it, but so far its been very useful</p>
