  <h2>Playing video games</h2>
  <a href="./hobbies.html">Go Back</a>
  <p>This is one of the another activity that I really like. I used to do it much more when I was younger and had more free time</p>
  <p>Nowadays, I cant do it so often, since I'm constantly occupied with something</p>
  <p>One of the games I spend most time playing is League of Legends.</p>
