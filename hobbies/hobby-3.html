  <h2>Watching TV Shows</h2>
  <a href="./hobbies.html">Go Back</a>
  <p>This is something I really love doing. It helped me to learn English language a lot.</p>
  <p>If i would find a good show, I can say goodbye to studying, because I will definitely binge watch it.</p>
  <p>One of my favourite TV Shows are Game of Thrones and Riverdale.</p>
